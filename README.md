# Hasenpfeffer-Rabbit-Stew
A traditional stew made by marinating and braising rabbit or hare in a spiced vinegar. This dish originated in Germany, and was very popular among my Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors. Rabbit meat is not currently very popular in the United States, but I am hoping that will change. Rabbit is one of the leanest most nutritious meats that exist. They are also easy to produce and have a very low impact on the environment.

 
8 to 10 pieces of dressed rabbit   

¼ cup fat 

1 teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon pepper

½ teaspoon allspice or cloves

1 medium-sized onion

2 heads garlic

2 bay leaves

½ cup vinegar

1 can tomato puree    

Roll pieces of meat in flour and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Fry until golden brown.

Place in a baking pan and add sliced onion, seasoning, vinegar and tomato puree.

Let simmer or bake at 350 for 1 to 1.5 hours.

Serves 8-10
